# GoogleAccountMaker

Application that lets you leverage Googles Single-Sign-On(SSO) status to create bulk "bot" accounts capable of logging into various sites and interacting with them via Python Selenium. To avoid IP-bans and IP-detection a personal IP Proxy that has been paid for will provide maximum security, as rotating IP addresses will ensure that the several requests being made from one source won't arouse suspicion. However, via web scraping popular publicly available free IP addresses that match certain requirements is also an option, as well as not using rotating IP proxies altogether via undetectable-chromedriver. Third party anticaptcha and captcha solving API's, as well as online phone numbers for sms verification are also utilized for ReCaptchas and general Captchas, and SMS Identity Verification respectively. These services are also used when manipulating the votes and subscriber/follower counts on the various sites as well, and creating accounts specifically for those sites, rather than using broad google ones, is also an option(with the paid proxy, free proxy, no proxy, anticaptcha, and phone verification services still in effect).

Coming soon: GUI update. Additional services such as youtube, twitch, tiktok, facebook, twitter in progress
